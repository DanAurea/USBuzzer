# USBuzzer
Have you ever dreamed of make your USB acts as a buzzer ?
If the answer is yes then this tool is made for you.
Otherwise you can still try it and see if it's suit your needs.

USBuzzer has been designed to reverse engineer USB devices, and especially find vulnerabilities
on embedded systems.
